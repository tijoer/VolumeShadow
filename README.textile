h1. HBaseXplorer

This is a lib for OpenGl projects written in Java. 
This project can create volumetric shadows for nearly all model data and scenes. Just pass your opengl context, a method to draw your scene (with different light settings) and your models (occluders). Voila: There is shadow.

h2. Features

* Basic volumetric shadow.
* Extrem easy to use.
* Z-Pass and Z-Fail will be supported.
* Undestandable code
* The code is extremly easy to reuse in different project.
* Still in development, so this is pre alpha.


h3. Build

There is a Netbeans and an Eclipse project. You will have to install Jogl first, and add it to your classpath. See http://jogamp.org/jogl/www/.

Maybee I will add an ANT or Maven build script in the future.


h4. Misc
This uses math and vector classes from the JMonkeyEngine project. If you use this project you also use JMonkeyEngine technology and need to read their licence (Something like: free to use, but you must give credits to them).
