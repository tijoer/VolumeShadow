h1. Overview

This is a lib for OpenGl projects written in Java. 
This project can create volumetric shadows for nearly all model data and scenes. Just pass your opengl context, a method to draw your scene (with different light settings) and your models (occluders). Voila: There is shadow.

h2. Features

* Basic volumetric shadow.
* Extrem easy to use.
* Z-Pass and Z-Fail will be supported.
* Undestandable code
* The code is extremly easy to reuse in different project.
* Still in development, so this is pre alpha.


h3. Checkout and Build

There is a Netbeans and an Eclipse project. You will have to install Jogl first, and add it to your classpath. See the "JOGL Homepage":http://â€¦http://jogamp.org/jogl/www/ for more informations.

Maybee I will add an ANT or Maven build script in the future.

If you don't know how to use GIT you can also use SVN to checkout this project. 
With @svn checkout http://svn.github.com/iuiz/VolumeShadow.git@


h4. Misc

This uses math and vector classes from the JMonkeyEngine project. If you use this project you also use JMonkeyEngine technology and need to read their licence (Something like: free to use, but you must give credits to them).
